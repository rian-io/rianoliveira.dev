This static site was built using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), with the blog functionality primarily based on the guide [Create a Blog with Nuxt Content](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content).

Content management is handled using [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/) and [nuxtjs/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org).

The implementation references the boilerplate repository [ntn-boilerplate](https://github.com/Knogobert/ntn-boilerplate), which demonstrates the integration of Nuxt.js with Netlify CMS.

The layout design was inspired by the template found at [nextjs-netlify-blog-template](https://github.com/wutali/nextjs-netlify-blog-template).

The site uses the [Ubuntu Font](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/), licensed under the [Ubuntu Font License](https://ubuntu.com/legal/font-licence).
