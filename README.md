[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9eff9025-fc7b-4831-a75e-6ced7e61015c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/rianoliveira/deploys)

This application is my web site. It has the purposes of study the technologies I like in front-end and to be a kind of notebook to general studies.

The design used is common in most of tools to build static sites, like [Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-codex/), if you want to use it without programming to much.

## Made with:

- [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org)
- [Color Mode](https://color-mode.nuxtjs.org)
- [Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org)

Deployed at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) using GitHub integration.
